* Use case diagrams and portals

A use case diagram is an overview of actors and interactions of a system. It
depicts which actors can interact with the system in which manners. From a use
case diagram one can generate a portal, which is a screen that guides the user
through the various possible system interactions.

** Example use case diagram and portal

This section goes through an example of what a use case diagram and a portal may
look like. Consider the following use case diagram.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file journal.uc.png
title Journal

actor :Administrator: as A
actor :Subscriber: as S

usecase (Ban subscriber) as BS
usecase (Post comment) as PC

A -|> S

A -- BS

S -- PC
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:journal.uc.png]]

From this diagram, the following value would be generated. The example is in
PureScript, but other languages may be targeted as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
journal
  :: forall f
   . { banSubscriber :: f Unit
     , postComment :: f Unit }
  -> Portal f
journal = {- implementation provided -}
#+END_SRC

From this value, various objects could be generated at runtime, among which
could be a user interface.
