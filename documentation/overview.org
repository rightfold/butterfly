* Overview

Butterfly is a tool that can generate stubs from diagrams. For now, the main
focus is on generating portals from use case diagrams.

** How it works

You invoke Butterfly giving it a diagram, and it will give you a set of
interfaces and programs that call those interfaces. You can then fill in the
interfaces to complete the program.

** Use cases

The current focus is to create a tool that can be used to generate portals.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file tool.usecase.png
title Butterfly

actor :Programmer: as P

usecase (Generate portal from use case diagram) as GP

P -- GP
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:tool.usecase.png]]

** Components

Butterfly consists of two component groups: the tool and the runtime support
libraries. The tool is an executable that turns diagrams into code, and the
runtime support libraries are linked to and invoked by the generated code.

The current focus is to generate PureScript code.
